Project Title - 
	# noVex - Connecting Novices with Experts in the coding world. 

Motivation - 
	It is difficult for novices to start out in the coding world. It can be tricky navigating the different languages and knowing where to start. It is also difficult sometimes for people to commit to a school schedule to learn the traditional way. This site aims to let novices and experts connect and start a dialogue for a working relationship. Experts create a profile and list and bio. They will list their skill sets and what they are comfortable teaching. Novices will search by category or location and can browse all the experts. Once they see someone they feel fits their needs they will contact them and see if a relationship can be agreed upon.
